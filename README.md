Background knowledge:
Trichomonas vaginalis is a human parasite that infects the urogenital tract of humans. It is an extracellular protozoa that infects by first attaching itself to the host epithelium. If left untreated, this infection can lead to higher susceptibility for HIV acquisition and development of cervical cancer in women. 
However, before it can cause infection, Trichomonas has to first overcome the natural protective barrier provided by the resident microflora, which mostly consists of Lactobacillus species. The lactobacilli utilises several mechanisms to thwart the parasite, of which competing for binding sites is one of them. Galectin-1 or Gal-1 is a carbohydrate-binding protein present on the surface of host cells and is a known binding receptor for Trichomonas parasite. Although not experimentally shown, it is possible that the lactobacilli too can bind to Gal-1 due to the chemical nature of its surface.  

Hypothesis:
Both the bacteria and the parasites compete with each other for binding to the Gal-1 receptor. 

Aim:
The aim of this project is to 
1. Confirm that the Lactobacillus can bind to Gal-1
2. If yes, determine how Trichomonas adhesion to Gal-1 is affected in presence of lactobacillus. 

Research design:
Galectin-1 is commercially available as a matrix-embedded protein. Pure cultures of lactobacilli will be added to wellplates containing the immobilised Gal-1 and incubated. At the end of the incubation period, the unattached lactobacilli will be washed away leaving behind the Gal-1 attached bacteria. The adherent bacteria will then be detached from Gal-1 enzymatically and collected for analysis by flow cytometry. Controls will contain empty matrix incubated with the bacteria. Data collected will be analysed for statistical significance and will be represented graphically.   
If an increase in bacterial attachment occurs, it would suggest that Gal-1 is a possible binding site for the bacteria during Trichomonas infections. 

To investigate the role of Lactobacillus in influencing Trichomonas attachment to Gal-1, wellplates containing Gal-1 will be incubated with both Trichomonas and lactobacilli and incubated. Control wells consist of Trichomonas and Gal-1 only. At the end of the incubation period, the unattached parasites will be washed away leaving behind the adherent Trichomonas, which will then be detached from Gal-1 enzymatically and collected for analysis by flow cytometry. Data collected will be analysed for statistical significance and will be represented graphically.  
If the number of adherent Trichomonas decreases as compared to the control, it would suggest that the Lactobacillus plays a role in mitigating Trichomonas attachment.
